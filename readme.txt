Introduction
    This is a simple project that i did in order to learn more about how php, html and css work.
    Once i learn some javascript and frameworks, maybe i could revisit this idea to see how it could be adjusted.
    The basic idea was to create a site that requires user input and connects with a database to store and retrieve this data.
    As i was hungry at the time the idea of a pizzeria seemed appropriate
    The design is kinda meh and simple but i can always improve it later.

Tools Used
    I used wampserver64 and phpMyAdmin to interact with the database.
    The file pizzaria.sql has to be executed in phpMyAdmin to create the database.
    The rest of the files were written through Visual Studio Code.
